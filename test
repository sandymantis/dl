Yes, you’ve captured the distinction well between pseudo-claims and the need for tracking ongoing gap closure efforts.

Pseudo-Claims
	•	Used when a gap has actually been closed, but no real claim will be generated.
	•	Typically submitted by approved internal sources (IQ, HPMC, CM, etc.).
	•	Serves as a hard closure mechanism in the system.
	•	Recognized and approved by auditors to confirm the closure.
	•	Not used to indicate that a gap is merely being worked on—it confirms that the work has been completed.

The Untracked Work-in-Progress Issue
	•	When a provider is working with a member (e.g., recommending a lab test but it hasn’t been done yet), the system currently does not capture this as an active effort.
	•	This leads to duplicate outreach from other internal teams (campaign managers, etc.), wasting resources and affecting member experience.
	•	There needs to be a way to record that work is in progress—not as a pseudo-claim, but as a separate status indicating that someone is actively working to close the gap.

Potential Solutions
	1.	Introduce a “Work-in-Progress” Status
	•	A separate mechanism (e.g., an interim status in the system) to indicate that a provider or internal resource is actively working to close the gap.
	•	This would prevent redundant member outreach efforts.
	2.	Enhance Internal Communication
	•	Ensure that different teams (IQ, HPMC, CM, campaign managers) have visibility into ongoing gap closure efforts before initiating additional interventions.




Centralized Pseudo-Claim Generation via API

Current Challenge:
	•	Multiple approved internal systems (IQ, HPMC, CM, etc.) independently generate pseudo-claims.
	•	This creates duplication, inconsistency, and additional maintenance overhead.
	•	Each system must separately ensure compliance with pseudo-claim approval rules.

Proposed Solution:
	•	Introduce a centralized API that acts as the single point of pseudo-claim generation.
	•	Instead of each system manually generating pseudo-claims, they simply call this API when a gap closure needs to be recorded.
	•	The API validates and processes the request, then triggers the pseudo-claim generation centrally.

Implementation Options:
	1.	Synchronous API Call Approach:
	•	Each system (IQ, CM, HPMC, etc.) calls the API when they determine a gap is closed.
	•	The API processes the request and generates a pseudo-claim under a unified logic.
	•	Ensures consistency across systems.
	2.	Event-Driven Approach:
	•	Instead of requiring explicit API calls, use event triggers.
	•	Example: When CM or HPMC marks a gap as closed in their system, it automatically fires an event.
	•	The pseudo-claim engine listens to this event and generates a pseudo-claim.
	•	This reduces direct integration points and allows for more scalable automation.

Benefits of a Centralized Approach:
	•	Consistency & Compliance: Ensures all pseudo-claims follow the same rules and approval processes.
	•	Reduced Maintenance: Instead of maintaining pseudo-claim logic in multiple systems, it is managed centrally.
	•	Scalability & Automation: Event-driven or API-triggered processing reduces manual intervention.
	•	Improved Tracking & Auditing: Since all pseudo-claims are generated from a single source, tracking and reporting become easier.

Next Steps

Would it make sense to first define the key data points that such an API would need? For example:
	•	Member ID
	•	Gap Type
	•	Closure Source (IQ, CM, HPMC, etc.)
	•	Date of Closure
	•	Evidence or Supporting Data (if required)

That way, we can design an API that aligns with both current and future needs. Thoughts?
