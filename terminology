## üîó **Clinical Ontology vs Terminology - Summary**

### üìö Key Definitions
- **Terminology:** A standardized **list of codes and terms** (e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC, RxNorm) created by external standards bodies.
- **Ontology:** A **structured model** that defines **concepts, relationships, and meaning** within a clinical or business domain. It‚Äôs more than just a list ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **knowledge graph**.
- **Custom Ontology Model (COM):** A **homegrown, internal ontology** created by an organization to act as its **single source of truth** for clinical concepts, linking to external terminologies as needed.

---

### üîÑ **Mapping**
Mapping = translation between terminologies or between a terminology and your custom ontology.
- Example: **SNOMED "Type 2 diabetes" maps to ICD-10 "E11.9".**
- Mappings can be:
    - **1-to-1** (clean match)
    - **1-to-many** (more than one valid target, requiring logic to choose)
    - **Many-to-1** (several detailed concepts collapse into one code)
    - **No match** (gap requiring manual handling)

---

### üî• Why COM is Powerful
‚úÖ Acts as a **neutral hub** connecting all incoming data (claims, EHR, public health feeds, etc.) into a single **canonical representation**.
‚úÖ Allows you to store **clinical relationships** ‚Äî e.g., diabetes ‚Üí needs retinal exam, diabetes ‚Üí treated by metformin.
‚úÖ Handles **non-1-to-1 mappings** gracefully by attaching **business rules** to decide how to translate.
‚úÖ Supports **both clinical and financial needs** (quality, risk adjustment, care management, etc.).
‚úÖ Supports **multi-domain coverage** ‚Äî conditions, medications, procedures, labs, allergies, immunizations, and more.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è External Terminologies ‚Äî What Each One Covers

| Domain | Common Terminologies |
|---|---|
| **Conditions (diagnoses)** | SNOMED CT (clinical), ICD-10 (billing) |
| **Medications** | RxNorm (prescribed), NDC (dispensed) |
| **Labs & Vitals** | LOINC |
| **Procedures** | CPT (billing), SNOMED CT (clinical) |
| **Immunizations** | CVX |
| **Allergies** | RxNorm (drugs), SNOMED (non-drug allergens) |
| **Social History, Family History** | SNOMED CT (often) |

---

### üîÑ Data Flow Example
```text
Incoming Data (Claims, CCDs, HIE, Labs, etc.)
     ‚¨áÔ∏è
Map to COM (each source maps to a canonical concept in your COM)
     ‚¨áÔ∏è
Store in Patient Record (conditions, meds, labs, procedures, allergies all in COM)
     ‚¨áÔ∏è
Use for:
   ‚úÖ Care management
   ‚úÖ Risk adjustment
   ‚úÖ Quality reporting
   ‚úÖ Analytics & population health
   ‚úÖ Reporting to external partners (map back to ICD, CPT, etc. when needed)
```

---

### üî• Example Relationship in COM (Diabetes)
```json
{
    "relationshipType": "linked_screening",
    "source": "DIAB_TYPE2",
    "target": "RETINAL_EXAM",
    "frequency": "annual",
    "guideline_source": "ADA"
}
```

### Relationships your COM can encode for each condition
| Type | Example for Type 2 Diabetes |
|---|---|
| **Diagnosed By** | HbA1c test |
| **Monitored By** | HbA1c, BMP, Lipid Panel |
| **Linked Screening** | Retinal Exam |
| **Treated By** | Metformin, GLP-1, Insulin |
| **Complications** | Retinopathy, Neuropathy, Nephropathy |

---

### üìä Example Relationship Table
| Source Concept | Relationship Type | Target Concept |
|---|---|---|
| DIAB_TYPE2 | linked_screening | RETINAL_EXAM |
| HYPERTENSION | linked_screening | RETINAL_EXAM |
| DIAB_TYPE2 | treated_by | METFORMIN |
| DIAB_TYPE2 | may_lead_to | DIABETIC_RETINOPATHY |

---

### üî• Key Distinctions
| Aspect | Terminology Management | COM Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | External standards only | Internal custom model |
| **Focus** | Keeping codes up to date | Defining relationships, groupers, care pathways, business logic |
| **Mapping** | SNOMED ‚Üí ICD, LOINC ‚Üí local codes | All incoming sources map to COM; COM maps out to external terminologies |
| **Relationships** | Rare | Fully explicit (conditions ‚Üí screenings, meds, procedures, labs, complications) |
| **Use Case** | Data quality & compliance | Analytics, decision support, cohorting, care gaps, pathway modeling |

---

### ‚úÖ When to Use What

| Goal | Recommended Approach |
|---|---|
| Short-term payer analytics (claims focus) | ICD-only (simple but limited) |
| EHR integration (clinical focus) | SNOMED-only (better for clinical) |
| Comprehensive longitudinal patient profile (multi-source, multi-purpose) | **COM (recommended)** |

---

### üö® What You Avoid with COM
‚ùå Mapping spaghetti (every system mapping directly to every other system).  
‚ùå Rebuilding the same rules (like care gaps) in every downstream tool.  
‚ùå Losing clinical richness when converting between terminologies.  
‚ùå Hard-coding condition lists separately for risk, quality, and care management.

---

### üí° Final Rule of Thumb
> **Terminology = clean codes. COM = smart data.**
> If you want your system to power **care management, quality, risk, analytics, AND reporting**, you need a **COM** (even if it starts small).

# üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Physician-Patient Journey ‚Äî End-to-End Coding Flow**

### üìç Scenario:
Patient visits the doctor with symptoms. Doctor suspects diabetes, orders tests, confirms diagnosis, prescribes meds, and bills the visit to insurance.

---

## ü©∫ **Step 1: Patient Visit (Complaint + Assessment)**

| Action | Coding System | Example Code |
|---|---|---|
| Document Symptoms | SNOMED CT | 267425008 (Polyuria) |
| Suspect Diagnosis | SNOMED CT | 44054006 (Diabetes Mellitus Type 2) |
| Bill the Visit | CPT | 99203 (Office visit - new patient) |

---

## üî¨ **Step 2: Order Lab Test (Confirm Diagnosis)**

| Action | Coding System | Example Code |
|---|---|---|
| Order HbA1c Test | LOINC | 4548-4 (Hemoglobin A1c) |

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 3: Receive & Document Lab Results**

|---|---|---|
| Prescribe Metformin | RxNorm | 866242 (Metformin 500mg tablet) |

---

## üí∞ **Step 5: Submit Claim to Insurance**

| Action | Coding System | Example Code |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnosis for Claim | ICD-10 | E11.9 (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus without complications) |
| Procedure for Visit | CPT | 99203 (Office Visit) |
| Medications (if part of claim) | HCPCS (optional) | J8499 (Oral prescription drug, non-chemo) |

---

## üíä **Step 6: Dispense Medication at Pharmacy**

| Action | Coding System | Example Code |
|---|---|---|
| Dispense Product | NDC | 00093-1045-01 (Teva Metformin 500mg bottle) |

| Labs Ordered & Results | LOINC |
| Prescriptions | RxNorm (prescribed), NDC (dispensed) |
| Procedures (Visit) | CPT |
| Diagnosis (for Billing) | ICD-10 (claims) |
| Medications (for Billing) | HCPCS (sometimes, if drugs are part of claim) |

---

# üî• Why So Many Terminologies?
| System Type | Preferred Coding System |
|---|---|
| Clinical Documentation (EHR) | SNOMED CT |
| Lab Systems (Orders & Results) | LOINC |
| Prescribing Systems (Medication Orders) | RxNorm |
| Pharmacy Systems (Product Dispensing) | NDC |

# üîó Example Real Flow (Visual)

```text
Patient visit ‚Üí Document symptoms (SNOMED)
            ‚Üí Suspect diabetes (SNOMED)
            ‚Üí Order HbA1c (LOINC)
            ‚Üí Confirm diabetes from result (SNOMED)
            ‚Üí Prescribe Metformin (RxNorm)
            ‚Üí Submit claim to payer (ICD-10 + CPT)
            ‚Üí Pharmacy dispenses Metformin (NDC)
```

---

# ‚úÖ Key Insight
- **Clinical language (EHR)** = SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm
- **Billing language (Claims)** = ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS
- **Pharmacy language** = NDC
- **Public health language (vaccines)** = CVX
- **Labs language** = LOINC

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Translation (Mapping) is Required
| From | To | Why Needed |
|---|---|---|
| SNOMED (diagnosis) | ICD-10 (billing) | Payers only accept ICD codes. |
| SNOMED (diagnosis) | Quality Program Rules | Some HEDIS measures are ICD-only. |
| RxNorm (prescription) | NDC (dispensing) | Pharmacies manage inventory by NDC. |
| LOINC (lab result) | Quality Programs | Some quality rules require specific LOINC results. |
